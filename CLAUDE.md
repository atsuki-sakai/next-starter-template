# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server at http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - Build production version using Next.js and OpenNext
- `npm run start` - Start production server locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript rules
- `npm run check` - Build project and run TypeScript type checking

### Cloudflare Deployment
- `npm run preview` - Build and preview locally before deployment
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
- `npm run cf-typegen` - Generate Cloudflare Workers types (updates env.d.ts)

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application configured for deployment on Cloudflare Workers using OpenNext.

### Key Components
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (not Node.js)
- **Deployment**: OpenNext Cloudflare adapter transforms Next.js build for Workers
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.1 (configured via PostCSS)
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- **TypeScript**: Configured with strict mode and path aliases (`@/*` â†’ `./src/*`)

### Project Structure
- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout with font configuration
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Main page component
- `public/` - Static assets and `_headers` file for Cloudflare
- `.open-next/` - Generated by OpenNext for Cloudflare Workers deployment

### Cloudflare Integration
- Uses `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter for Workers compatibility
- Cloudflare environment types auto-generated in `env.d.ts`
- Wrangler configuration in `wrangler.jsonc` for deployment
- OpenNext configuration in `open-next.config.ts` (R2 cache disabled by default)

### Development Notes
- Development server uses OpenNext Cloudflare dev initialization
- Static assets served through Cloudflare Workers ASSETS binding
- Observability and source maps enabled for production builds
- Uses `nodejs_compat` and `global_fetch_strictly_public` compatibility flags

### Testing & Quality
- ESLint configured with Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript rules
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Use `npm run check` to verify both build and types before commits
